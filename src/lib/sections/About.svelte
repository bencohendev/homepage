		Coding started as a means to an end, but has become my passion Shortly after college I moved to
		NYC to pursue my dreams of becoming a jazz saxophonist. After a long stint of restaurant work to
		make ends meet, I started learning web development as a way to support myself between gigs. Then
		came the pandemic and there were no more gigs. I decided to get more serious about code At this
		time, I was ready to move on from the platform e-commerce work I'd been doing with Codacity and
		work on something more custom. Antidote Games provided me with a great opportunity to focus on
		sharpening my JS chops and start building and deploying more sophisticated custom websites.
		After a year with Antidote, I was ready to take the next big step Since then, I've built a
		variety of sophisticated, cutting edge products that solve real world problems for users. I've
		also found I have a deep passion for writing good clean code and for collaborating with teams of
		highly skilled engineers, designers, and product engineers, all with the end user firmly in
		mind. Using my firm foundations in Typescript, Javascript, React, Svelte, Angular, Git, Node,
		AWS and a variety of other tools and platforms, I love working in Scrum and Agile environments.
		I'm always looking for ways to increase efficiencies through time tested processes to speed up
		delivery of excellent features. And I have a proven track record of building successful products
		that have led to massive increases in user bases and revenue for my clients. So let's get in
		touch and see what we can build together!
